# Pokemon-finder

This is a simple Pokemon finder web app. It allows users to search for Pokemon by name and display information about the Pokemon.The code you have provided is an HTML file that can be used to create a simple Pokemon finder web app. The file starts with a declaration of the document type (<!DOCTYPE html>), followed by the HTML lang attribute, which specifies the language of the document (en for English). The meta tags in the head section of the document specify the character encoding (UTF-8) and the viewport (width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0). The title tag specifies the title of the document (Pokemon-finder). The link tag specifies the href of the CSS file that will be used to style the document (style.css).

The body section of the document contains the main content of the web app. The first div element with the class name mainContainer contains a form with two input fields and two buttons. The first input field is used to enter the name of the Pokemon to search for. The second button is used to search for the Pokemon. The third button is used to reset the search form.

The second div element with the class name cardsContainer is used to display the results of the search. This div element is empty at the moment, but it will be populated with cards containing information about the Pokemon when the user searches for a Pokemon.

The last line of the document is a script tag that specifies the href of the JavaScript file that will be used to implement the functionality of the web app (script.js).
